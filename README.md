# NetBlinkIT
Raspberry Pi Based Network Bandwidth Monitor using BlinkIt!

This is a Raspberry Pi Based Network Monitoring Device that will use SNMP to connect to your home router, and can display the % of network use on the RaspberryPI BlinkIT Module.

To use this, you must have a home router that supports SNMP.  This has been tested on the Unifi EdgeRouter.
